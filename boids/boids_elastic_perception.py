    alignment, separation, and cohesion. Boids supports generalizations
    to arbitrary dimension (as much as your computing power would allow).
    It also supports extensio ntdexisting behavioral rules and fine
    tuning of how much each rule affects the boids' behaviors.

    Attributes:

            The number of dimension of the simulation.

            The number of boids to be simulated.
        env_bounds: List[int]
            The size in each dimension of the simulated environment.

            The maximum velocity for all boids.
